**Mega Agent MCP** is a production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives Large Language Models a wide set of external capabilities: web search, article extraction, GitHub analysis, document parsing, browser automation, secure code execution, and forum parsing.

The project focuses on being a fast, lightweight, and self-hostable backend that works with any MCP-compatible client or AI model.

## Why Mega Agent MCP

Most MCP servers implement one or two tools. Mega Agent MCP combines many capabilities into a single optimized server while keeping security, performance, and resource usage under control.

It removes the need to run five different MCP servers by providing one unified, async-first backend with its own SQLite caching, Docker sandboxing, and rate limiting.

## Features

**Web Search & Reading**
- Web Search — searches the internet through SearXNG with language selection and BM25 ranking.
- Article Reader — extracts clean content via a cascade parser (`Trafilatura` → `Readability` → `jusText` → `BeautifulSoup`). Automatically strips ads, sidebars, and scripts.
- Smart Search + Read — a Perplexity-style pipeline: search → BM25 ranking → download → extract → merge top results.
- JavaScript Browser — uses Playwright Chromium for JS-heavy sites (React, Vue, SPAs).

**GitHub Integration**
- Repository Reader — analyzes repo trees, extracts `README.md`, and detects default branches via the GitHub REST API without cloning.
- File Reader — downloads and reads individual source files or docs directly from public repositories.

**Forum Parsing**
- Reddit Parser — recursively parses nested Reddit discussions via the JSON API, with sorting, time filters, and internal BM25 search.
- 4PDA Parser — reads full 4PDA forum topics, supporting `recent`, `full thread`, and `first/last page` modes while skipping duplicate header posts.

**Secure Code Sandbox**
Runs code in strictly isolated Docker containers (Python, C, C++, Java, Node.js, PHP).
- Security layers: network disabled, read-only filesystem, non-root user (`nobody`), capability dropping, seccomp profile support, `no-new-privileges`, CPU/RAM/PID limits, `tmpfs` mounts.

**Document & Visual Processing**
- Document Reader — parses PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, XLS, CSV, and ODS, with smart PDF text extraction and block ordering.
- Smart OCR — uses Tesseract OCR; if a PDF is a scanned image, falls back to rendering the page and extracting text visually.
- HTML Renderer — uses Playwright to render raw HTML/CSS and generate screenshots (useful for AI UI generation and previews).

## Performance

- Fully asynchronous architecture — async HTTP calls, parallel downloads, async DB operations
- SQLite cache with WAL mode, TTL-based, to cut network overhead
- Persistent Playwright browser sessions
- RAM-cached BM25 retrieval — lightweight, semantic-like ranking without heavy GPU embeddings
- Minimal memory footprint

---

## Security

Mega Agent MCP includes several security layers by default:
- **SSRF protection** — strict URL validation; blocks loopback, private networks, multicast, and link-local addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
- **Input validation** — hard limits on request payloads (max 1 MB input) and file sizes (max 50 MB documents)
- **Rate limiting** — sliding-window rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PanPersil/MegaAgent-MCP.git
cd MegaAgent-MCP
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Requires Python 3.11+. A virtual environment is recommended.
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browser for rendering
playwright install chromium
```

`requirements.txt` should include, among others:
```
mcp[cli]>=1.0.0
fastmcp>=0.1.0
httpx>=0.27.0
aiosqlite>=0.20.0
trafilatura>=1.9.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
readability-lxml>=0.8.1
justext>=3.0.0
lxml>=5.2.2
rank-bm25>=0.2.2
cachetools>=5.3.0
docker>=7.1.0
playwright>=1.44.0
PyMuPDF>=1.24.0
python-docx>=1.1.2
python-pptx>=0.6.23
pandas>=2.2.0
Pillow>=10.3.0
pytesseract>=0.3.10
openpyxl>=3.1.2
odfpy>=1.4.1
uvicorn>=0.30.0
```

### 3. System dependencies
Not everything is installable via pip. Mega Agent MCP also requires:
- Docker
- Chromium (installed automatically via `playwright install chromium`)
- Tesseract OCR
- SearXNG

On Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

### 4. Start SearXNG (web search backend)
```bash
# Create a dummy settings file if you don't have a custom one
touch settings.yml

# Run SearXNG container
docker run -d --name searxng -p 8888:8080 -v $(pwd)/settings.yml:/etc/searxng/settings.yml searxng/searxng

# Enable auto-restart so it survives reboots
docker update --restart unless-stopped searxng
```

### 5. Run the server
```bash
python server.py
```
The server listens for MCP connections via Streamable-HTTP/WebSocket on `http://0.0.0.0:8100/mcp`.
